        "**Introduction to SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the realm of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), software design and development are guided by a set of fundamental principles known as the SOLID principles. These principles serve as a compass, providing developers with a clear direction on how to build maintainable, scalable, and robust software systems. SOLID is an acronym that stands for five essential design principles: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).\n",
        "\n",
        "The SOLID principles were first introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as \"Uncle Bob,\" in the early 2000s. They have since become cornerstones in software architecture and design, forming the foundation for writing clean, modular, and extensible code. By adhering to these principles, developers can create software that is more adaptable to change, easier to test, and less prone to bugs and maintenance headaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) emphasizes the importance of having a class or module with a single, well-defined responsibility. In other words, a class should have only one reason to change. This principle encourages the separation of concerns, making the codebase more manageable and reducing the risk of introducing errors when modifying code.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) encourages software entities to be open for extension but closed for modification. It advocates designing classes and modules in a way that allows them to be easily extended to add new functionality without modifying their existing code. This promotes code reusability and prevents unnecessary disruptions in the existing system during updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) focuses on the behavior of derived classes in relation to their base classes. It states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without altering the correctness of the program. In other words, derived classes should adhere to the contract set by their base classes and not introduce unexpected behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) emphasizes that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead, the principle promotes the creation of specific, smaller interfaces that cater to the needs of individual clients. This helps prevent the creation of bloated interfaces and keeps the system more cohesive and flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather both should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes the use of interfaces or abstract classes to decouple different parts of the system, allowing for easier swapping of components and reducing tight coupling.\n",
        "\n",
        "By understanding and applying these SOLID principles, software developers can create code that is more maintainable, extensible, and easier to comprehend. They provide a roadmap for designing modular and scalable systems, making it possible to adapt to changing requirements and ensuring a higher quality of software development in the long run."

        "1. Use meaningful variable and function names: Choose descriptive names that accurately represent the purpose or functionality of the variables and functions. This improves code readability and makes it easier to understand the code's intent.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Write modular and well-organized code: Break your code into smaller, self-contained functions or modules. Each function should have a clear purpose and perform a single task. This improves code readability and allows for easier maintenance and testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Use comments and docstrings: Add comments and docstrings to explain the purpose, functionality, and usage of your code. Well-documented code helps other developers (including your future self) understand and use the code effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Handle errors and exceptions gracefully: Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors or exceptions in your code. By handling errors gracefully, you can prevent program crashes and provide meaningful error messages to users or developers.\n",

        "<br>a) Import all necessary libraries at the end of your code.\n",
        "<br>b) Import libraries as you need them throughout the code.\n",
        "<br>c) Import the entire standard library to ensure availability.\n",
        "<br>d) Do not use any external libraries to maintain code simplicity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. When working with large datasets, what is the best approach to load the data efficiently using Pandas?\n",
        "<br>a) Use the `pd.load_data()` function.\n",
        "<br>b) Load the entire dataset into memory at once.\n",
        "<br>c) Use generators or chunking to read the data in smaller portions.\n",

        "3. To make your code more maintainable and readable, what should you do with variable names?\n",
        "<br>a) Use single-letter variable names to save space.\n",
        "<br>b) Avoid meaningful names as they make the code longer.\n",
        "<br>c) Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables.\n",
