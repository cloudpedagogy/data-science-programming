        "In data visualization, understanding the distribution of data is crucial for gaining insights and making informed decisions. Distribution plots, also known as univariate plots, are a powerful tool to visualize the distribution of a single variable in a dataset. They allow us to explore the underlying patterns, central tendencies, spread, and potential outliers present in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Seaborn offers a variety of distribution plots that make it easy to create insightful visualizations with just a few lines of code. These plots are aesthetically pleasing and provide a quick overview of the data's distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's take a look at some of the commonly used distribution plots in Seaborn:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Histograms:** Histograms are one of the simplest and most common distribution plots. They divide the data into a set of bins and display the frequency of observations within each bin. Histograms help us visualize the data's shape, whether it is skewed to the left or right, or if it follows a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) Plots:** KDE plots provide a smooth estimation of the probability density function of the data. Instead of representing the data as discrete bins, KDE plots use a continuous curve to represent the distribution, making it easier to identify underlying patterns and trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Rug Plots:** Rug plots are one-dimensional scatter plots that place a small vertical tick at each data point's location along the x-axis. They help visualize the individual data points and their distribution on the number line.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Box Plots:** Box plots, also known as box-and-whisker plots, display the distribution of data through quartiles. They show the median, upper and lower quartiles, and any potential outliers. Box plots are useful for comparing the distributions of multiple variables or groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Violin Plots:** Violin plots combine the features of KDE plots and box plots. They display the KDE on each side of a central box plot, providing a more comprehensive view of the data's distribution, including the density of observations at different values.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Swarm Plots:** Swarm plots are scatter plots that place data points along the x-axis while avoiding overlapping. They help visualize the distribution of individual data points and their frequency.\n",
        "\n",
        "These distribution plots can be easily customized using Seaborn's styling and formatting options to make them more informative and visually appealing. Whether you are exploring a single variable or comparing multiple variables, distribution plots in Seaborn offer a powerful way to gain insights into your data quickly.\n",

        "1. Histograms and KDE:\n",
        "   - Histograms are graphical representations of the distribution of a dataset, where the data is divided into bins and the height of each bin represents the frequency or probability of occurrence.\n",
        "   - To create a histogram in Python, you can use the `hist` function from Matplotlib or the `distplot` function from Seaborn.\n",
        "   - Binning refers to the process of dividing the range of values into intervals (bins). The number and width of bins impact the level of detail and smoothness of the histogram.\n",
        "   - Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric technique that estimates the probability density function of a random variable. It smooths the histogram representation by using a kernel function.\n",
        "   - Python libraries like Seaborn provide the `kdeplot` function to plot a KDE curve alongside a histogram.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Box Plots and Violin Plots:\n",
        "   - Box plots display the quartiles, median, and outliers of a dataset, providing a summary of its distribution and identifying potential anomalies.\n",
        "   - You can create box plots in Python using the `boxplot` function from Matplotlib or the `boxplot` function from Seaborn.\n",
        "   - Violin plots combine a box plot with a kernel density estimation, providing a more detailed representation of the data distribution, including multiple modes and density variations.\n",
        "   - Box plots are typically used to compare multiple datasets or visualize a single dataset, while violin plots are useful for understanding the density and shape of a distribution.\n",
        "   - Python libraries such as Seaborn offer the `violinplot` function to create violin plots for different types of datasets.\n",
