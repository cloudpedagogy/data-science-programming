The more hidden layers there are, the deeper the network is, hence \"deep learning.\" Each neuron in a hidden layer transforms the values from the previous layer with a weighted linear summation followed by a non-linear activation function.\n",

        "**Keras** is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. As of 2021, TensorFlow is the default and most commonly used backend for Keras.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose of Keras:** Keras was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. It allows for easy and fast prototyping, supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, and is capable of running seamlessly on both CPU and GPU.\n",

        "**Functionality of Keras:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **User-friendly:** Keras has a simple, consistent interface optimized for common use cases. It provides clear and actionable feedback for user errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Modular and Composable:** Keras models are made by connecting configurable building blocks together with few restrictions.\n",

        "**Main Components of Keras:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Layers:** These are the building blocks of Keras models. Keras offers a wide range of pre-defined layers that can be stacked together to create a model. This includes dense (fully connected) layers, convolutional layers, recurrent layers, and others.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Models:** In Keras, a model is a way to organize layers. The simplest type of model is the `Sequential` model, a linear stack of layers. For more complex architectures, you can use the Keras functional API, which allows for arbitrary layer graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optimizers:** Keras has many built-in optimizers, such as SGD, RMSprop, Adam, etc. Optimizers are algorithms or methods used to adjust the attributes of the neural network such as weights and learning rate to reduce the losses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Loss functions:** These are used by the optimizer to navigate the space of weights. Common loss functions include categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification, binary cross-entropy for binary classification, and mean squared error for regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Regularizers:** These are used to apply penalties on layer parameters or layer activity during optimization. Regularization methods like L1, L2, and Dropout help to prevent overfitting in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Metrics:** Metrics are used to judge the performance of your model. Metric functions are similar to loss functions, except that the results from evaluating a metric are not used when training the model. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, AUC-ROC, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "To sum it up, Keras is a powerful tool that supports a broad range of deep learning models and techniques, and makes building and testing these models more accessible and easier for users.\n"
