It serves as the foundation for making informed decisions and forming hypotheses before diving into more complex modeling and statistical techniques. EDA is an essential practice in the data science workflow and is typically performed as a preliminary step before any formal modeling or hypothesis testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, EDA can be efficiently performed using a wide range of libraries and tools, making it a popular choice among data professionals. Some of the widely used Python libraries for EDA include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. These libraries offer robust data manipulation, visualization, and statistical capabilities, enabling data scientists to explore and interact with their data effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the EDA process, data is thoroughly examined to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables. Data cleaning and preprocessing steps are also taken to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies that might affect the analysis. Exploring summary statistics, histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices are common techniques employed during this phase.\n",
        "\n",
        "EDA plays a crucial role in identifying potential challenges and limitations in the dataset. It helps in uncovering data quality issues and can often reveal the need for further data collection or refinement. By visualizing and summarizing the data, analysts can also generate hypotheses about the relationships between variables, which can later be tested through more advanced statistical methods or machine learning algorithms.\n",
        "\n",

It also helps in selecting appropriate features for predictive models and deciding on the most suitable data transformation techniques.\n",
